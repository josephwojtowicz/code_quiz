This is the repo for my Homework #4 project, Code Quiz. 

This project is a simple quiz consisting of five questions.

Using JavaScript, a start button initializes the quiz, and you are given
75 seconds to complete the quiz. For each incorrect answer you give, 10 seconds
are penalized from your allotted time. After you complete the quiz, you are given 
the option to enter your initials into a high score page.
